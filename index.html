      </div>
      <p>
        Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when
        nobody
        else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you need no matter what you do in
        life to stay focused on your path.Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on
        around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action
        steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other
        distractions that life presents to them.

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Science has a simple faith, which transcends utility. Nearly all men of science, all men of learning for that
        matter, and men of simple ways too, have it in some form and in some degree. It is the faith that it is the
        privilege of man to learn to understand, and that this is his mission. If we abandon that mission under stress
        we shall abandon it forever, for stress will not cease. Knowledge for the sake of understanding, not merely to
        prevail, that is the essence of our being. None can define its limits, or set its ultimate boundaries.

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>
        I've learned that fear limits you and your vision. It serves as blinders to what may be just a few steps down
        the road for you. The journey is valuable, but believing in your talents, your abilities, and your self-worth
        can empower you to walk down an even brighter path. Transforming fear into freedom - how great is that ?

      <h3>goals</h3>
      <p>
        Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.
        When we take our eyes off of our goals, anxiety, worry, and doubt immediately begin to take over. Stay focused
        on what matters most at all times. Picture yourself achieving your goals and what that feels like instead of the
        obstacles that you will experience along the way.

      <h2>Develop Without Limit</h2>
      <p>Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and
        partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the knowledge and
        skills they need for successful implementation.
        Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.
        Great staff could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>

      <h2>Know Our Global Community</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community. There
        are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools,
        code reviews, answering questions, and much more.Communities are usually built on shared struggles of
        individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community differ per the individual's
        collective needs.

      <h2> Stay Safe With <br> Corona </h2>
      <p>f you feel unwell, here’s what to do.

        If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first
        and follow the directions of your local health authority.
        Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough,
        tiredness and loss of taste or smell. Less common symptoms include aches and pains, headache, sore throat, red
        or irritated eyes, diarrhoea, a skin rash or discolouration of fingers or toes.
        Stay home and self-isolate for 10 days from symptom onset, plus three days after symptoms cease. Call your
        health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or
        have someone near you, wear a properly fitted mask to avoid infecting others.
